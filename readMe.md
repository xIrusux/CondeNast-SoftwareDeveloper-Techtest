# TOP NEWS WORLDWIDE 

[![Build Status](https://www.travis-ci.org/fac-17/PFAK-week5.svg?branch=master)](https://www.travis-ci.org/fac-17/PFAK-week5)
![Heroku](https://heroku-badge.herokuapp.com/?app=belo-wk5)

## Installation instructions 

Clone the repo with: 
```
git clone https://github.com/fac-17/PFAK-week5.git
```

Install all dependencies with: 
```
npm install
```
The project requires you to have a file .env in main directory, containing the API key. Our team will provide you with tha content of that file on request. Alternativel, you can get your own API key and add a .env file to the root folder with: 

```
DB_APIKEYNEWS=your_own_APIkey
```

Once you have all dependencies and the API key, you can run the server with: 

```
npm start
```


## Third-party resources

News API: https://newsapi.org/

## User Journey
Our user is a traveller or language learner wants to find out the trending headlines in a country of interest. The app returns the top three headlines for the selected country. 

The user can use one of the four quick search buttons, or select the country from a drop down menu. 

### Edge Case
If the user, does not select a country before clicking the search button, an alert message will pop up. 

## Design and Architecture
- File structure: all client-side files in public folder, all server-side files in src folder
- All client-side JS in index.js 
- One front-end API call directed to our server
- One back-end API call directed to external news API

- Mobile first design

## What we struggled with :angry: 
- Adding the API key 

## What we learned :satisfied:
- Finally understood how the front-end talks to the back-end
- **Network** tab in Inspect 
- dotenv works better than env2 (we learnt to always look at the weekly downloads - many downloads are a positive sign )
